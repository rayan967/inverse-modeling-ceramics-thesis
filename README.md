# Inverse-Modeling-Ceramics-Thesis

This thesis aims to extend the findings of the paper [Top-down material design of multi-phase ceramics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) by designing bottom up models for the design of ceramics. The repository consists of ongoing documentation of literature review and weekly progress, along with the code implementation.
