- [Data centric nanocomposites design via mixed-variable Bayesian optimization](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/me/d0me00079e) 

In summary, the authors discuss a data-centric design framework for polymer nanocomposites. The paper focuses on tailoring nanocomposites to meet specific application requirements by concurrently identifying optimal composition and microstructure using mixed-variable Bayesian optimization since their case involves both quantitative and qualitative  variables,  such as the choice of polymer or surface modification.
