# Forward Models Papers

- [Adaptive Gaussian Process Regression for Efficient Building of
Surrogate Models in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05824.pdf) 

In summary, the authors propose an approach that involves constructing a GPR surrogate model through adaptive sampling of design space, selecting the next training data using a greedy-type strategy, evaluating the surrogate model's approximation error based on its impact on parameter accuracy, and optimizing the combination of sample points and evaluation tolerance using estimates of computational work. They also consider improving the accuracy of existing sample points through continued finite element solution procedures.

- [Mechanical behavior predictions of additively manufactured microstructures using functional Gaussian process surrogates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line)

In summary, the authors propose an architecture to form GPR forward models within the context of RVE microstructures to model functional data.

- [Neural Network Based Inverse System Identification from Small Data Sets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8851722)

In summary, the authors propose an architecture to form NN forward models using virtual sample generation to address small data learning problem for neural networks.
