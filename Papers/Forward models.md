# Forward Models Papers

- [Adaptive Gaussian Process Regression for Efficient Building of
Surrogate Models in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05824.pdf) 

In summary, the authors propose an approach that involves constructing a GPR surrogate model through adaptive sampling of design space, selecting the next training data using a greedy-type strategy, evaluating the surrogate model's approximation error based on its impact on parameter accuracy, and optimizing the combination of sample points and evaluation tolerance using estimates of computational work. They also consider improving the accuracy of existing sample points through continued finite element solution procedures.

A similar methodology to solve the inverse heat transfer problem, using a surrogate model for optimizing an inverse solution; parts of the paper are not accessible through uni credentials.

- [A deep learningâ€“based method for the design of microstructural materials](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-019-02424-2)

A DNN application to inverse design of microstructures based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The DCGAN is used to generate design candidates that satisfy geometrical constraints and the CNN is used as a surrogate model to link the microstructure to its properties. Once trained, the two networks are combined to form the design network which is utilized to for the inverse design.

- [Multi-target regression via input space expansion: treating targets as inputs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-016-5546-z)

Multitarget regression by statistical dependencies between targets is exploited by building a separate model for each target on an expanded input space where other targets are treated as additional input variables (might not be relevant since there might not be any statistical dependence between variables).
